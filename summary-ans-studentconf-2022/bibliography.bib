	abstract = {The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), a DOE Category A reactor, was designed to provide an irradiation test environment for conducting a variety of experiments. The ATR Safety Analysis Report, determined by DOE to meet the requirements of 10 CFR 830, Subpart B, provides versatility in types of experiments that may be conducted. This paper addresses two general types of experiments in the ATR facility and how safety analyses for experiments are related to the ATR safety basis. One type of experiment is more routine and generally represents greater risks; therefore this type of experiment is addressed with more detail in the safety basis. This allows individual safety analyses for these experiments to be more routine and repetitive. The second type of experiment is less defined and is permitted under more general controls. Therefore, individual safety analyses for the second type of experiment tend to be more unique from experiment to experiment. Experiments are also discussed relative to "major modifications" and DOE-STD-1027-92. Application of the USQ process to ATR experiments is also discussed.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, deep learning in neural networks demonstrated impressive successes in the areas of computer vision, speech and image recognition, text generation, and many others. However, sensitive engineering areas such as nuclear engineering beneﬁted less from these efﬁcient techniques. In this work, deep learning expert systems are utilized to model and predict time series progression of a design-basis nuclear accident, featuring a loss of coolant accident. Two major ﬁndings are accomplished in this work. First, the ability to train expert systems with high accuracy, which could help nuclear power plant operators to ﬁgure out plant responses during the accident. Second, building fast, efﬁcient, and accurate deep models to simulate nuclear phenomena, which could be valuable to nuclear computational science. In this work, large amount of time series data is obtained from simulation tools by simulating different conditions of the base-case/nominal accident scenario. Four critical outputs/responses are monitored during the accident (e.g. temperature, pressure, break ﬂow rate, water level). Two approaches are adopted in this work. The ﬁrst approach is to use feedforward deep neural networks (DNN) to ﬁt all time steps and outputs in a single model. The second approach is to use long short-term memory (LSTM) to ﬁt all time steps together for each reactor response separately. Both DNN and LSTM demonstrate very good performance in predicting the test and base-case scenarios, with accuracy as low as 92\% and as high as 99\%, where these test scenarios are unknown to the expert systems and are not included in the model training. In addition, both approaches demonstrate a signiﬁcant reduction in computational costs, as the deep expert system is able to accurately predict the accident 100,000 times faster than the original simulation tool. Given sufﬁcient data, the methodology adopted in this study demonstrates that DNN/LSTM expert systems can be used as a decision support system to model advanced time series phenomena within nuclear power plants with high accuracy and negligible computational costs.},

	abstract = {Accident diagnosis is one of the complex tasks for nuclear power plant (NPP) operators. In abnormal or emergency situations, the diagnostic activity of the NPP states is burdensome though necessary. Numerous computer-based methods and operator support systems have been suggested to address this problem. Among them, the recurrent neural network (RNN) has performed well at analyzing time series data. This study proposes an algorithm for accident diagnosis using long short-term memory (LSTM), which is a kind of RNN, which improves the limitation for time reﬂection. The algorithm consists of preprocessing, the LSTM network, and postprocessing. In the LSTM-based algorithm, preprocessed input variables are calculated to output the accident diagnosis results. The outputs are also postprocessed using softmax to determine the ranking of accident diagnosis results with probabilities. This algorithm was trained using a compact nuclear simulator for several accidents: a loss of coolant accident, a steam generator tube rupture, and a main steam line break. The trained algorithm was also tested to demonstrate the feasibility of diagnosing NPP accidents.},

This paper describes OpenFOAM, a C++ object oriented library for Computational Continuum Mechanics (CCM) developed by the author. Efficient and flexible implementation of complex physical models is achieved by mimicking the form of partial differential equation in software, with code functionality provided in library form. Open Source deployment and development model allows the user to achieve desired versatility in physical modeling without the sacrifice of complex geometry support and execution efficiency.},

	abstract = {Natural circulation, which is employed in the design of a small modular reactor, influences the removal of decay heat from the upper header of a pressure vessel under severe accident conditions. This phenomenon has been emphasized for a better understanding of passive safety systems. In this paper, a Reynolds-averaged turbulence model is used to simulate turbulent natural convection in a rectangular enclosure with a curved surface heated from below. The simulation results are first compared with the Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of a differ­ ential heated cavity obtained from the literature. A good agreement demonstrated the ability of the employed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach to predict turbulent natural convection flow and its induced heat transfer. Consequently, the turbulent natural convection formed in a rectangular enclosure heated by a curved surface was investigated. The ensemble average was employed to evaluate the local Nusselt number distribution quantitatively as well as the velocity and temperature distributions. Their dependency was also evaluated based on a systematic CFD simulation that covers a wide range of Rayleigh numbers. Least square regression analysis was employed to propose a correlation to predict the averaged Nusselt number as a function of the Rayleigh number. The influence of the thermal boundary conditions and the discrete heater was also determined.},

Using the ORIGEN2.1 code, emission rates of delayed gamma rays were calculated in consideration of the activation procedure for 8 years and 2 months of HANARO operation. Calculated emission rates were used as a source term of delayed gamma rays in the MCNP6 code. By using the MCNP code, the nuclear heating rates of the irradiation capsules in the inner core, outer core, and heavy water reﬂector tank were estimated. Calculated nuclear heating in the inner core, outer core, and heavy water reﬂector tank were 200e260 mW, 80e100 mW, and 10 mW, respectively.},

In order to predict the thermal and ﬂuid dynamic behavior of the ﬂow in these cavities, the location of transition to turbulence should be accurately determined. In this work, the performance of three subgrid-scale (SGS) models is submitted to investigation in a water-ﬁlled cavity of aspect ratio 5 at Rayleigh number Ra ¼ 3 Â 1011. To do so, the models are compared with the solution obtained by means of direct numerical simulation. The models tested are: (i) the wall-adapting local-eddy viscosity (WALE) model, (ii) the QR model, (iii) the WALE model within a variational multiscale framework (VMS-WALE). It has been shown that the VMS-WALE and WALE models perform better in estimating the location of transition to turbulence, and thus their overall behavior is more accurate than the QR model. The results have also revealed that the use of SGS models is justiﬁed in this ﬂow as the transition location and consequently the ﬂow structure cannot be captured properly if no model is used for the tested spatial resolution.},

This paper focuses on applications related to three key subareas related to safety and decision-making. These are reactor health and monitoring, radiation detection, and optimization. The principles of learning-based methods in these applications are explained and recent studies are explored. Furthermore, as these methods have become more practical during the past decade, it is foreseen that the popularity of learning-based methods in nuclear science and technology will increase; consequently, understanding the benefits and barriers of implementing such methodologies can help create better research plans, and identify project risks and opportunities.},

It is open-source and released under the same GNU General Public License (GPL) as OpenFOAM. The source code is released as a publicly open software repository that includes detailed documentation and tutorial cases. Since mdFoam+ is designed entirely within the OpenFOAM C++ object-oriented framework, it inherits a number of key features. The code is designed for extensibility and flexibility, so it is aimed first and foremost as an MD research tool, in which new models and test cases can be developed and tested rapidly. Implementing mdFoam+ in OpenFOAM also enables easier development of hybrid methods that couple MD with continuum-based solvers. Setting up MD cases follows the standard OpenFOAM format, as mdFoam+ also relies upon the OpenFOAM dictionary-based directory structure. This ensures that useful pre- and post-processing capabilities provided by OpenFOAM remain available even though the fully Lagrangian nature of an MD simulation is not typical of most OpenFOAM applications. Results show that mdFoam+ compares well to another well-known MD code (e.g. LAMMPS) in terms of benchmark problems, although it also has additional functionality that does not exist in other open-source MD codes.},

Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

	abstract = {Forecasting shoreline evolution for sandy coasts is important for sustainable coastal management, given the present-day increasing anthropogenic pressures and a changing future climate. Here, we evaluate eight different time-series forecasting methods for predicting future shorelines derived from historic satellite-derived shorelines. Analyzing more than 37,000 transects around the globe, we find that traditional forecast methods altogether with some of the evaluated probabilistic Machine Learning (ML) time-series forecast algorithms, outperform Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) predictions for the majority of the sites. When forecasting seven years ahead, we find that these algorithms generate better predictions than OLS for 54\% of the transect sites, producing forecasts with, on average, 29\% smaller Mean Squared Error (MSE). Importantly, this advantage is shown to exist over all considered forecast horizons, i.e., from 1 up to 11 years. Although the ML algorithms do not produce significantly better predictions than traditional time-series forecast methods, some proved to be significantly more efficient in terms of computation time. We further provide insight in how these ML algorithms can be improved so that they can be expected to outperform not only OLS regression, but also the traditional time-series forecast methods. These forecasting algorithms can be used by coastal engineers, managers, and scientists to generate future shoreline prediction at a global level and derive conclusions thereof.},

	abstract = {Nuclear infrastructure systems play an important role in national security. The functions and missions of nuclear infrastructure systems are vital to government, businesses, society and citizen's lives. It is crucial to design nuclear infrastructure for scalability, reliability and robustness. To do this, we can use machine learning, which is a state of the art technology used in various ﬁelds ranging from voice recognition, Internet of Things (IoT) device management and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose to design and develop a machine learning algorithm to perform predictive maintenance of nuclear infrastructure. Support vector machine and logistic regression algorithms will be used to perform the prediction. These machine learning techniques have been used to explore and compare rare events that could occur in nuclear infrastructure. As per our literature review, support vector machines provide better performance metrics. In this paper, we have performed parameter optimization for both algorithms mentioned. Existing research has been done in conditions with a great volume of data, but this paper presents a novel approach to correlate nuclear infrastructure data samples where the density of probability is very low. This paper also identiﬁes the respective motivations and distinguishes between beneﬁts and drawbacks of the selected machine learning algorithms.},

	abstract = {The continuous advancements in computer power and computational modeling through high-ﬁdelity and multiphysics simulations add more challenges on assessing their predictive capability. In this work, metamodeling or surrogate modeling through deep Gaussian processes (DeepGP) is performed to construct surrogates of advanced computer simulations drawn from the nuclear engineering area. This work is centered around three major ideas: (1) surrogate modeling through deep Gaussian processes (DeepGP), (2) simulation assessment through surrogate-based uncertainty quantiﬁcation (UQ) methodologies, and (3) drawing conclusions regarding the underlying uncertainty of the four simulations considered in this paper. First, DeepGP models are trained, optimized, and validated to yield variety of features: (1) achieving high accuracy (small error metrics) on the validation set, (2) automatically capturing the surrogate model uncertainty (i.e. interpolation errors), (3) ﬁtting multiple outputs with diﬀerent scales simultaneously, (4) handling high dimensional input spaces, and (5) learning from small data amounts. Second, the validated DeepGP surrogates are utilized to eﬃciently perform UQ tasks such as uncertainty propagation (through Monte Carlo sampling), parameter screening (through Morris screening), and variance decomposition (through Sobol Indices) to investigate the selected simulations. Third, the thermal-hydraulics (ﬂuid ﬂow) results demonstrate the importance of inlet temperature uncertainty in void fraction predictions. For the reactor physics application (fuel depletion/consumption), DeepGP accurately captures the uncertainty in criticality calculations, which is about 0.6\% (i.e. a considerable value for this application). For the application of kinetic parameters (nuclear data), DeepGP successfully explains 95\% or more of the variance in all 12 outputs. Finally, DeepGP-based UQ analysis of the fuel performance application (materials science) shows the importance of the clad surface temperature, fuel porosity, and linear heat rate in explaining the variance of the maximum fuel centerline and surface temperatures.},

An autonomous algorithm is a higher-level concept than conventional automatic operation in nuclear power plants (NPPs). In order to achieve autonomous operation, the autonomous algorithm needs to include superior functions to monitor, control and diagnose automated subsystems. This study suggests an autonomous operation algorithm for NPP safety systems using a function-based hierarchical framework (FHF) and a long short-term memory (LSTM). The FHF hierarchically models the safety goals, functions, systems, and components in the NPP. Then, the hierarchical structure is transformed into an LSTM network that is an evolutionary version of a recurrent neural network. This approach is applied to a reference NPP, a Westinghouse 930 MWe, three-loop pressurized water reactor. This LSTM network has been trained and validated using a compact nuclear simulator.},

It is presently constructed using support vector regression (SVR) with training data generated by multiple cases of a one-dimensional reactor system model. A particle ﬁltering framework is utilized to estimate and update model parameters with noisy instrument measurements. Veriﬁcations of the prediction and ﬁltering models have been carried out using the TFHR reactivity insertion events.

A brief overview of FDD methods is presented in this paper. FDD methods are classiﬁed into model-based methods, data-driven methods, and signal-based methods. While practical applications of model-based methods are very limited, various data-driven methods and signal-based methods have been applied for monitoring key subsystems in NPPs. In this paper, six areas of such applications are considered. They are: instrument calibration monitoring, instrumentation channel dynamic performance monitoring, equipment monitoring, reactor core monitoring, loose part monitoring, and transient identiﬁcation. The principles of using FDD methods in these applications are explained and recent studies of advanced FDD methods are examined.

	abstract = {The ability to characterize used nuclear fuel (UNF) is important for nuclear nonproliferation safeguards, criticality safety, and fuel storage. Multiple efforts have been made to estimate the burnup (BU), initial enrichment (IE), and cooling time (CT) based on multivariate models of isotopic concentrations and radiation signatures of the fuel. This work provides a comparison of multivariate modeling techniques and extends previous work by quantifying the uncertainty of the best model to predict each characteristic. Model inputs used are simulated gamma and neutron emissions from UNF of varying BU, IE, and CT. Modeling techniques explored include Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLS), Principal Component Regression (PCR), and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS). Multiple PCR and PLS models were built based on different variable selection methods, such as cross validation and Akaike Information Criteria. The OLS model predictions have a root mean square percent error (RMSPE) of less than 10\%, but the models are very unstable. The PCR models exhibit a trade-off between accurate and stable predictions. The best performing PCR and PLS models have similar predictions errors, but the PLS models are favored due to their stability. The best model for each characteristic is a single output PLS model based on cross validation. The uncertainty of each of these models, based on their prediction variance and biases, is 0.220 GWd/MTU, 0.051\% U-235, and 0.694 years for the BU, IE, and CT models, respectively. By building a 95\% prediction interval based on the corresponding uncertainty of each characteristic, 1.97\% of the BU predictions, 23.03\% of the IE predictions, and 100\% of the CT predictions lack 95\% confidence that they are within the prescribed accuracy requirement for the characteristic.},

	abstract = {Implicit in any engineering design is an underlying optimization problem, although the exact objective function to be optimized is rarely stated explicitly. Nuclear systems optimization is as old as the discipline of nuclear engineering. Advanced manufacturing in the nuclear industry has opened the door for the re-examination of optimization in a way in which it was not possible before, namely, determining the optimal geometry for a given objective function. A trivial example is the sphere as the shape that minimizes the volume (or mass) of bare fissile material in a critical configuration. However, the problem becomes less trivial under even the simplest of multiphysics considerations. In this work, we develop the solution methodology for finding the minimum volume geometric configurations under the multiphysics constraints of 1,500 pcm excess reactivity and maximum fuel temperature of 618°C under forced-flow cooling conditions. Constraining the solution geometry only to right cylinders, surprisingly yields two disjoint solution regions. Flat, wide (disk-like) cylinders and tall, narrow (rod-like) cylinders both satisfy the constraints and yield very similar minimal volumes. However, the ultimate pursuit of this work is truly arbitrary geometry.},

The rapid advancements in computational performance, storage capacity, and big data management have allowed machine-learning techniques to improve in the areas of learning speed, non-linear data handling, and complex features identiﬁcation. Machine-learning techniques have proven successful and been used in the areas of autonomous machines, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Though the application of artiﬁcial intelligence in the nuclear engineering domain has been limited, it has accurately predicted desired outcomes in some instances and has proven to be a worthwhile area of research.

This study uses data from multiple sensors, focusing primarily on the reactor pressure vessel and its internal components. As a result, the artiﬁcial neural networks are able to predict the behavior of the system with good accuracy in each scenario. Its ability to provide technical data can help decision makers to take actions more rapidly, identify safety issues, or provide an intelligent system with the potential of using pattern recognition for reactor accident identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation.

	abstract = {A hybrid artificial neural network is used to model the thermodynamic behavior of the Tennessee Valley Authority's Sequoyah nuclear power plant using data for heat rate measurements acquired over a 1-yr pe-
riod. The modeling process involves the use of a self-organizing network to rearrange the original data into several classes by clustering. Then, the centroids of these clusters are used as the training patterns for an artificial neural network that utilizes
backpropagation training to adjust the weights on the connections between artificial neurons. This procedure greatly reduces the training time and reduces the system error. Comparison of the calculated heat rates with those predicted by the artificial neural network gives an error of
{\textless}0.1\%. A sensitivity analysis is then performed by taking the partial derivative of the heat rate with respect to each individual input to secure a sensitivity co-
efficient. These coefficients identified the input variables that were most important to improving the heat rate and efficiency. The methodology reported is an alternative to the conventional modeling procedures used in other heat rate monitoring systems. It has the advantage that the artificial neural network model is based on actual plant data that cover the dynamic range normally occurring over an annual cycle of operation, and it is not subject to linearization or empirical approximations. This process could be utilized by existing heat rate monitoring systems.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a method, based on the artiﬁcial neural network technique, to predict accurately and in real time the power peak factor in a form that can be implemented in reactor protection systems. The neural network inputs are the position of control rods and signals of ex-core detectors. The data used to train the networks were obtained in the IPEN/MB-01 zero-power reactor from especially designed experiments. The relative error for the power peak factor estimation ranged from 0.19\% to 0.67\%, an accuracy better than what is obtained performing a power density distribution map with in-core detectors. The networks were able to identify classes and interpolate the power peak factor values. It was observed that the positions of control rods bear the detailed and localised information about the power density distribution, and that the axial and the quadrant power diﬀerences, obtained from signals of ex-core detectors, describe its global variations in the axial and radial directions. In the power reactor environment, the neural networks would require in the input vector the position of control rods, and axial and quadrant power diﬀerences. The results showed that the RBF networks produced slightly better results than the MLP networks, but, for practical purposes, both can be considered of similar accuracy. The results indicate that they may allow decreasing the power peak factor safety margin by as much as 5\%.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the training of an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) to accurately predict, in very short time, a physical parameter used in nuclear fuel reactor optimization: the local power peaking factor (LPPF) in a typical boiling water reactor (BWR) fuel lattice. The ANN training patterns are distribution of ﬁssile and burnable poison materials in the fuel lattice and their associated LPPF. These data were obtained by modeling the fuel lattices with a neutronic simulator: the HELIOS transport code. The combination of the pin U235 enrichment and the Gd2O3 (gadolinia) concentration, inside the 10 Â 10 fuel lattice array, was encoded by three different methods. However, the only encoding method that was able to give a good prediction of the LPPF was the method which added the U235 enrichment and the gadolinia concentration. The results show that the relative error in the estimation of the LPPF, obtained by the trained ANN, ranged from 0.022\% to 0.045\%, with respect to the HELIOS results.},

Nuclear fuel management optimization is a classical nuclear engineering problem, which has been studied extensively and several techniques, including genetic algorithms, have been used for its solution. The study presented in this paper addresses the overall procedures and methods developed for the application of genetic algorithms in the optimization studies of nuclear fuel management. The result obtained from a study that explores a typical application of genetic algorithm in nuclear fuel management is also presented. Finding out of optimal number of fuel subassemblies in the core of a nuclear reactor (having power generating capacity of 500 MWe) is taken up for the study. The results demonstrate the suitability and efficiency of the algorithm in generating feasible solutions for the selected optimization problem.},

The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.},

As opposed to traditional data-flow oriented computational frameworks, MOOSE is instead founded on the mathematical principle of Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov (JFNK). Utilizing the mathematical structure present in JFNK, physics expressions are modularized into “Kernels,” allowing for rapid production of new simulation tools. In addition, systems are solved implicitly and fully coupled, employing physics-based preconditioning, which provides great flexibility even with large variance in time scales. A summary of the mathematics, an overview of the structure of MOOSE, and several representative solutions from applications built on the framework are presented.},

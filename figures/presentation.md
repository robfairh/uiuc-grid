# iCAP:

* American College and University Presidentsâ€™ Climate Commitment (2008)
* Become carbon neutral as soon as possible, no later than 2050.
* Development of the iCAP (2010)
* Comprehensive roadmap toward a sustainable campus.
* The iCAP defines a list of goals, objectives, and potential strategies for several topical areas:
  * Energy Conservation and Building Standards
  * Energy generation, Purchasing, and Distribution
  * Transportation
  * Water and Stormwater usage
  * Purchasing, Waste, and Recycling (Zero Waste)
  * Agriculture, Land Use, Food, and Sequestration

# ABBOTT:

* Built in 1940.
* Supplies 70-75% of the campus energy demand.
* Cogeneration facility: steam and electricity.
* Types of energy sources:
  * Two gas turbines (natural gas or fuel oil)
  * Three gas-fired boilers (natural gas or fuel oil)
  * Three coal-fired boilers
* High-pressure steam spins a turbine to drive a generator and produce electricity.
* Low-pressure exhaust steam for space heating, water heating, and space cooling.
* Electrical capacity 85 MW.

# Rail Splitter:

* Operation began in 2009.
* Located in Tazewell and Logan Counties.
* Power output: 100.5 MW.
* 67 turbines of 1.5 MW.
* Power purchase agreement:
  * November 2016 - October 2026
  * 8.6% of the total wind generation

# Solar Farm 1.0:

* Operation began in 2015.
* Power output: 4.68 MWac.
* Total modules: 18,867.
* Land usage: 20.8 acres.
* Power purchase agreement: 2015-2025.
* Solar Farm 2.0:

# Reactors:

* Grid demand < 80 MW.
* Limited on-site preparation requirements.
* Factory-fabricated components.
* Components shipped out to generation site.
* Black starts and islanding operation mode.
* Passive safety systems, minimizing electrical parts.


# Li-ion Batteries

* Charge-Discharge Efficiency: 80-90%
* Rechargeable battery
* First prototype developed in 1985
* High energy density and low self-discharge
* Can cause explosions and fires
* Capacity fading over hundreds to thousands of cycles
* Applications:
  * Portable Power Packs: Laptops and cellphones
  * Electric Vehicles (EVs)
  * Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS): computers, communication technology, medical technology.
  * Solar power storage


# Electrolysis:

* Commercial use since 1890.
* Most common technologies:
  * Alkaline-based
  * Proton exchange membrane (PEM)
  * Solid Oxide (SOEC)
* Low temperature electrolysis (LTE)
* High temperature electrolysis (HTE)
